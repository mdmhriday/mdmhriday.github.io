#### Overview : 
This project aims to investigate the effect of various data augmentation techniques on the performance of self-supervised learning (SSL) architectures. Here we focused on three prominent SSL architectures: SimCLR, BYOL, and Barlow Twins. By systematically applying and evaluating different augmentation strategies, we identified the most effective approaches for enhancing SSL performance.

#### Objective : 
- To evaluate the performance of SimCLR, BYOL, and Barlow Twins with different data augmentation techniques.
- To understand the impact of each augmentation strategy on the learning process and model performance.
- To identify the optimal combination of augmentations for each SSL architecture.

#### Context: 
This project was completed as part of the "Unsupervised Deep Learning" course during the Summer 2023 semester.
