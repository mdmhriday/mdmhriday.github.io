I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Visual Computing. My research interests lie in the fields of Computer Graphics and Vision, Generative Models, and 3D Computer Vision. My work primarily focuses on developing innovative techniques to advance computer vision technologies.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
