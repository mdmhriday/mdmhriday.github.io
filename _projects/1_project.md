#### Objective : 
The goal of this project group is to enhance the quality of 3D rendered scene. 

#### Context: 
This project was completed as part of the "Project" course during the Winter 2023/2024 and Summer 2024 semester.

#### My Role:

As a Computer Science student specializing in Visual Computing, I was responsible for:

- Designing and implementing neural network architectures combining components from Hourglass, Unet and Resnet structures.
- The model processes inputs such as albedo, normal, depth, and RGB images, optimizing for realistic and high-quality output based on physical-based rendering properties.
