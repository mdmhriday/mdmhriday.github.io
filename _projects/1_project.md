Objective : The goal of this project group is to improve the performance of a 3D renderer. In general, increasing the level of detail in synthetic images demands exponentially more computational resources.

Context: This project was completed as part of the "Project" course during the Winter 2023/2024 and Summer 2024 semester.

My Role:
As a Computer Science student specializing in Visual Computing, I was responsible for:

Designing and implementing both implicit and explicit neural network architectures.
Training and optimizing different architectures to improve their performance.
